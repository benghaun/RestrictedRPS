This is an implementation of Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors using the Mojo FPGA board. 

The rules of the game are as follows:
1. At the start of the game, each player will recieve between 2-3 each of rocks, papers and scissors. The sum of rocks, papers and scissors owned by both players will always be equal to 5. For example, if player 1 has 3 rocks, 2 scissors and 1 paper, then player 2 will have 2 rocks, 3 scissors and 4 papers.

2. The players then play games of rock-paper scissors against each other. The first player to win three rounds wins the game.

3. If either player uses up all their moves (no remaining rocks, papers and scissors), the game ends in a draw.
